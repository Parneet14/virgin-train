5W&H
•	Who is involved: public sector as British Rail (BR),25 TOCs, Office of Rail Regulation,
 West Coast and Cross Country, Virgin Rail Group, Virgin management, Government, stagecoach group, staff, Stakeholder, Political
•	Who is affected: BR, people, Virgin Rail Group, Virgin management,
•	Who will benefit: Virgin Rail Group, Virgin management, people,
•	Who will be harmed: West coast and cross country, Virgin Rail Group, Virgin management, people.

•	What is your topic narrowed down in a simple phrase/sentence? The Problems  associated with the lease between Virgin Rail and Government
•	What does your topic involve? (i.e. What are the different parts to it?) Investment, building infrastructure, growth in traffic, Finances
•	What might be affected/changed by your topic? Job creation, improved journey experience, expansion to the track

•	When does this take place? When did this take place? When will it take place? When should this take place? Between 1996- 2012 
•	Does when this takes place affect the topic? It explains the changes that happens with the privatization of BR rails

•	Where does this take place? (Where did it …. Where will it … Where should it ….?) Britain
•	Does it matter where it takes place? Is it affected by location?  Yes. The BR was going through losses, so it gave the railways on lease to TOCs 

•	Why is this topic important? Why does it matter? From business point of view the topic explains the growth of BR with involvement of competent private sector partner Virgin Rails and virgin Management to the west coast and what steps more required to be taken in consideration by both parties.
•	Why do certain things happen? (What are some causes and effects within the topic?) 
with the separation of infrastructure from operations, franchising of passenger services, and selling off freight operations. the ROSCOs have leased most new locomotives, coaches, and multiple units to passenger train operating companies.

•	How does this topic work? How does it function? How does it do what it does? Govt gave lease of west coast and cross country to TOCs 
•	How did it come to be? Projection for revenue during the time of biding should be figured out more accurately. More attention to be provided to the details of building infrastructure and estimated investment and actual investment need not to be such a big different.
•	How are those involved affected? Contract between Govt and Virgin Rails demolished for west coast before the time.
Business Modeling Tools
 • Identify and Design Relationship (relationship diagram to visualize patterns between business concepts) Data Based Diagram once we complete SQL. 
Using the Six Stage Problem-Solving Process answer each of the question below: 
1.	Exploring the mess: 
•	Problem: The problem of going in loss of BR due to which they give it on lease to TOCs. The overly projection of bids by Virgin during the time of filing tender.
Over going of budget during the expanding infrastructure
•	Where was there a gap between the current situation and the desired one: Expecting same volume of customers even during the period of recessions had most frequent long distance trains 
Spending 9 billion pound over the budget
Speed constraints due to signals
 Dissatisfied Customers with the services they are getting as compared to the prices

2.	Searching for information: 
•	Identify Root Causes: The completion of infrastructure leads to end of subsidies due to which Virgin needs to pay all the surplus to Govt. Over bidding reduces operating profit low
•	Dimensional Modeling: SSAS, SQL ,SSIS
•	Visualization: PowerBI, Tableau, excel 
•	Legal Implications: Lease contract, lawyers, policies, agreements with Govt & TOCs, Political Leaders, stakeholders, Contractors

3.	Identifying a problem: 
•	Cause of the problem: Ignorance of small problems that were emerging from the starting and become drastic with the passage of time.
Failed to protect commercial interest of the company and other operators
Complexity of the infrastructure
•	Data collected related to the problem: What we create in SQL. 
•	Verify original problem statement: The problem of going in loss of BR due to which they give it on lease to TOCs. 
The overly projection of bids by Virgin during the time of filing tender.
Over going of budget during the expanding infrastructure
•	Identify root cause of the problem: Inexperience, Overbidding, Complexity of infrastructure, Recession, low operating profit

4.	Searching for solutions: 
•	For all problems identified, provide/generate potential solutions that will address root causes of the problem: 
Reduce over long-distance trains
Layoffs
Hike in ticket prices
Utilizes the capability of 225KPH
Sell extra trains 
Constant observation on every regulation bodies and immediately taken corrective steps

5.	Evaluating solutions
•	Costs: It affects the reputation of company which they can cure once everything back on track to save the current situation
•	Timeline: Reduce over long-distance trains, Layoffs, Hike in ticket prices can be implemented immediately
Utilizes the capability of 225KPH after reducing the trains so less signals may be required for less trains it may takes 8-12 months by observing requirement and implementing on few distances first
Sell extra trains it may takes 6-12months
•	Expected Outcomes: Increase in profit and give more importance to commercial interest


6.	Implementing solution 
•	Risk associated and how to mitigate: Layoff of potential employee, uncertainty of hike in price, decision on the price of trains.
•	Internal/external factors will affect solutions: Staff, customer 
•	Implementation process: Documentation of small to big problem emerged and solution 
Build profit and revenue database systems to ensure accurate values
•	Audience, security, access to data: confidential information (mailing address, phone number, first name, last name, preferred products per customer) 
•	Solution & data delivery: accurate reporting frequently to ensure smoothly flow of process, operating profit.
•	Reporting &/or self-service: accurate reporting frequently to ensure product preferences are updated, customer was satisfied with delivery.
